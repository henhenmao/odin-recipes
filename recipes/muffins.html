        <h1>how to make blueberry muffins</h1>
        <p>This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy breakfast muffins with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I
        usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style
        muffin. Add extra blueberries if you want! This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. A buttery streusel topping takes this
        indulgent breakfast over the top.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients (8 servings i guess)</h2>
        <h3>For the muffins</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the crumb topping</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.</li>
            <li>To make the crumb topping: Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.</li>
